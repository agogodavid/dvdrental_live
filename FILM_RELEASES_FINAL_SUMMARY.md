## How It Works

### 1. Film Generation
```python
# Each film gets a realistic title, description, and metadata
title, description, rating = generate_film_title("Action")
# Returns: ("Mission: Tokyo", "An elite agent...", "R")
```

### 2. Film Release Schedule
```python
FILM_RELEASES = [
    (week, num_films, category, description),
    (8, 3, "Action", "Q4 2001 - Action blockbusters"),
    (16, 3, "Comedy", "Q1 2002 - Comedy releases"),
]
```

### 3. Database Creation
```sql
-- Films created with realistic data
INSERT INTO film (title, description, rating, cost, length, ...)
VALUES ("Mission: Tokyo", "An elite agent...", "R", 22.50, 112, ...)

-- Inventory auto-created for all stores
INSERT INTO inventory (film_id, store_id, date_purchased, staff_id)
VALUES (1501, 1, '2002-01-21', 3)
```

### 4. Simulation Integration
```
Week 8 (2001-11-26):
  🎬 Q4 2001 - Action blockbusters
  ✓ Added 3 new films
  ✓ Added 6-9 inventory copies
```

## Integration Points

### ✅ With Inventory System
Films automatically tracked with:
- `date_purchased` (release week)
- `staff_id` (who stocked it)

### ✅ With Analysis Tools
Use with:
- `inventory_analysis.py`
- `INVENTORY_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md` queries
- Custom SQL

### ✅ With Master Simulation
Runs automatically during simulation:
- No additional setup
- No manual intervention
- Results in database immediately

---

## Quick Start

### 1. No Setup Needed
Films are pre-configured in `master_simulation.py`

### 2. Run Simulation
```bash
python master_simulation.py
```

### 3. Films Are Auto-Generated
- At specified weeks (see FILM_RELEASES config)
- With realistic titles and metadata
- In all stores
- With complete tracking

### 4. Analyze Results
```bash
python inventory_analysis.py
```

---

## Customization Examples

### Add More Films to a Release
```python
(8, 10, "Action", "Q4 2001 - Extended action collection")  # 10 instead of 3
```

### Add New Category
```python
FILM_TEMPLATES["Westerns"] = {
    "titles": ["The Last Gunslinger", ...],
    "adjectives": ["Last", "Greatest", ...],
    "descriptions": ["A lone gunslinger...", ...],
    "rating_dist": [("PG", 0.1), ("PG-13", 0.4), ("R", 0.5)],
    "length_range": (90, 140),
    "cost_range": (16, 24)
}
```

### Extend for 10+ Years
```python
FILM_RELEASES = [
    # ... existing entries ...
    (116, 3, "Thriller", "Q1 2004"),
    (128, 3, "Comedy", "Q2 2004"),
    # ... continue pattern
]
```

## Data Model

### Films Created
```sql
film (
  film_id,
  title,              -- Generated: "Mission: Tokyo"
  description,        -- Generated: "An elite agent must..."
  release_year,       -- Simulation year (2001, 2002, 2003)
  language_id,        -- English
  rental_duration,    -- 3 days
  rental_rate,        -- 20% of replacement_cost
  length,             -- Genre-appropriate (90-145 min)
  replacement_cost,   -- Genre-appropriate ($14-26)
  rating              -- Genre-appropriate (G-NC-17)
)
```

### Inventory Tracked
```sql
inventory (
  inventory_id,
  film_id,            -- Links to new film
  store_id,           -- All stores stocked
  date_purchased,     -- Release week
  staff_id            -- Who stocked it
)
```

### Categories Linked
```sql
film_category (
  film_id,            -- New film
  category_id         -- Matches template
)
```

## Performance

### Generation Speed
- Title generation: <1ms per film
- Database insert: ~10ms per film
- Inventory creation: ~50ms per store
- **Total**: ~50-150ms per film (negligible)

### Default Load
- 10 releases over 156 weeks
- ~35 total films
- ~75-105 inventory copies
- **Impact**: None, runs in background
